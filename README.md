Task Manager Application
This is a basic MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack application that allows users to manage a list of tasks.

Requirements
Backend (Node.js and Express):
Set up a Node.js and Express server.
Create routes for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.
Connect the backend to a MongoDB database for data storage.
Frontend (React):
Create a React application with components for:
Displaying the list of tasks.
Adding a new task.
Editing an existing task.
Deleting a task.
Integration:
Connect the React frontend to the Node.js backend to perform CRUD operations.
Ensure proper error handling and validation on the frontend and backend.
User Interface:
Design a simple and user-friendly interface for the task management application.
Use appropriate styles and layout for a clean and intuitive look.
Bonus (Optional):
Implement user authentication (sign-up, login, logout).
Add sorting or filtering options for tasks.
Include unit tests for the backend or frontend components.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your system.
MongoDB installed and running locally.
Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-manager.git
Install dependencies for both backend and frontend:


cd task-manager/backend
npm install

cd ../frontend
npm install
Configuration
Backend: Create a config.js file in the backend directory and define your MongoDB connection URI and a secret key for JWT authentication:


module.exports = {
  mongoURI: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/task-manager',
  jwtSecret: 'your-secret-key'
};
Frontend: If needed, adjust the backend API URL in the frontend components to match your environment.
Running the Application
Start the backend server:


cd ../backend
npm start
Start the frontend:


cd ../frontend
npm start
Access the application at http://localhost:3000.
User Authentication
To enable user authentication, implement the sign-up, login, and logout functionality in the respective frontend components. Use secure practices for token storage and retrieval.

Remember to handle requests to the backend for user sign-up, login, and logout in the respective components.

In a real-world application, consider using libraries like jsonwebtoken for token generation and validation. Additionally, use HTTPS for secure communication between the frontend and backend.

Sorting and Filtering
To add sorting or filtering options for tasks, implement the necessary UI elements and backend routes/controllers to handle these operations.

Unit Tests
Include unit tests for backend and/or frontend components to ensure the application's reliability and robustness.

Submission
Create a GitHub repository for your project and share the link with us.

Additional Notes
Ensure proper error handling and validation in both the frontend and backend for a robust application.
For a production environment, consider using HTTPS for secure communication and additional security measures.
Feel free to customize this README further based on your specific project details. Make sure to provide clear instructions for running the application locally, configuring any necessary environment variables, and any other relevant information.
